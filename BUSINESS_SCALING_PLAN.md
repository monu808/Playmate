- Build strong brand loyalty through superior service
- Create network effects (more turfs = more users = more turfs)
- Move fast, capture 80% market share in 6 months

### Turf Owner Churn
**Risk:** Owners leave platform after getting customers
**Mitigation:**
- Continuous value addition (marketing, analytics, tools)
- Competitive commission rates
- Long-term partnership incentives
- Make yourself indispensable for their operations

### Low Booking Density
**Risk:** Not enough bookings to sustain
**Mitigation:**
- Aggressive initial marketing (spend to acquire)
- Focus on retention (cheaper than acquisition)
- Build habits through notifications, reminders
- Create FOMO through social proof

### Cash Flow Issues
**Risk:** Marketing spend before revenue breakeven
**Mitigation:**
- Bootstrap initial phase (₹50k-1L personal investment)
- Revenue-based spending (only spend 60% of revenue on marketing)
- Explore small business loans (₹2-5L)
- Friends & family funding round
